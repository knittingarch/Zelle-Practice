We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.

See there how easy that is. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Fluff that up. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.

Nothing wrong with washing your brush. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Do an almighty painting with us.
