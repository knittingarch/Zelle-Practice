This is the way you take out your flustrations. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Let's do that again. With practice comes confidence.

In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. You're meant to have fun in life. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.

Let's build an almighty mountain. We'll have a super time. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.

Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.

This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.

Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. There it is. See there, told you that would be easy.

Let your imagination be your guide. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.
